<!-- // The player will have to guess the answer, just like in Hangman. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters.
// Here's how the app works:

// There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
// The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

// When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.


// Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
// When they do click one, update the player's score counter.


// The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
// The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

// The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.


// When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.


// The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.



// Option 1 Game design notes


// The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
// Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12. -->
